# Dental Diagnosis
A Machine Learning project to apply image recognition to dental diagnostics.

We start this repository as a base-workspace to create a machine learning application helping doctors to identify periodontal disease, to begin.
We are going (hopefully) to extend this approach to other diseases in the next future.

Stay connected, and please comment with your suggestions.
